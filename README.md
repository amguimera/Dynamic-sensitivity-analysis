# Dynamic-sensitivity-analysis
A little script I have developed in MATLAB to perform dynamic sensitivity analysis on ODE models of biological systems. This sort of analysis can be useful to interpret changes in the system sensitivity to regulation and interventions at different simulated times. See link to a paper below that shows the insights that can be gained from performing this sort of analysis. See also the 'readme' file with useful/essential indications on how to use the script. Note that it involves creating a Simbiology model using the template provided within the script. A little example model is incorporated into the script where the user's model would be initially defined so that if you run the script as it is you should be able to see the kind of output it produces (for a small example model).   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4159174/
